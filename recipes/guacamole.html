    <h1> Guacamole </h1>

    <img src="../images/guacamole.jpg" alt="A bowl of freshly prepared guacamole, with a bowl of tortilla chips in the background.">

    <p> Guacamole is a creamy dish that pairs well with plenty of other foods. Use it as a dip for tortilla chips, or serve it on top of a grilled salmon or baked chicken! 
        Regardless of what you pair it with, guacamole is best served with fresh ingredients, and when everything is perfectly ripe.  </p>
    <p> Some purists say adding tomatoes & onions to mashed avocados makes a chunky salsa, rather than guacamole. We're not here to listen to the haters; we're just on the search for divine flavor! 
        This recipe yields about 2 quarts of guacamole - perfect for a party of 10+ people, or keep it all for yourself after everyone cancels on you!

<h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul> 
        <li> 8-10 Large Avocados </li>
        <li> 1-2 Jalapeños </li>
        <li> 2-3 Roma Tomatoes</li>
        <li> 1 Lime </li>
        <li> 1 Medium Onion </li>
        <li> 1/4 Cup Cilantro </li>
        <li> 1 tsp Salt, and more to taste </li>
        <li> Black Pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

<h2> Steps </h2>

    <ol>
        <li> Cut each avocado in half and discard the pits. Use a spoon to scoop the avocados into a large bowl. </li>
        <li> Use a potato masher to mash the avocados to your desired consistancy. Set aside. </li>
        <li> Dice the onion & tomatoes. Mince the jalapeño. </li>
        <li> Finely chop the cilantro. </li>
        <li> Add all ingredients to the mashed avocados. Cut the lime in half and squeeze the juice into the bowl. </li>
        <li> Fold all ingredients together, until combined. </li>
        <li> Eat with tortilla chips, tacos, or your bare hands! </li>
    </ol>

<h2> Additional Notes </h2>

    <ul> 
        <li> This recipe can be simplified to avocados and salt. Use as many or as few ingredients as you have on-hand to make it! </li>
        <li> Guacamole is best eaten fresh. If you're waiting to serve or saving leftovers (Ha!), cover the bowl with plastic wrap and press down to remove as much air as possible.
             Alternatively, place in an airtight container. Guacamole will keep fresh for up to 3 days. </li>
        <li> Similar to apples & bananas, avocados will brown quickly when exposed to air. Scoop any brown guacamole out or mix it throughout the batch before consuming. </li>
    </ul>
