    <p> Rice paper wraps are a healthy, versatile food you can mix & match with your favorite fillings! </p>
    <p> These wraps can be sweet or savory, a light snack or a hearty dinner. You can make 
        them cold for a refreshing crunch, or serve them piping hot with a spicy sauce. This makes them great 
        if you have a lot of ingredients you need to use, or if you have a family with picky 
        eaters!
    </p>
    <p> Since there are so many options to make these, it's hard to pick a single recipe for them.
        Feel free to substitute any fillings you don't like with something that suits your palate.
    </p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        
    <h3> Wraps </h3>

    <p> These particular ingredients can be eaten raw for a crisp, light snack, or cooked and seasoned
        for a more savory experience.
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Rice Paper </li>
            <li> Jasmine Rice </li>
            <li> Bell Pepper </li>
            <li> Lettuce </li>
            <li> Avocado </li>
            <li> Cucumber </li>
            <li> Carrots </li>
        </ul>

    <h3> Dipping Sauce </h3>

    <p> These ingredients yield about <strong> 1/2 cup </strong> of sweet & spicy sauce. 
    It pairs perfectly with any savory fillings. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong> 1/2 Cup </strong> Mango, cut into chunks or blended </li>
            <li><strong> 1-2 tsp </strong> Chili Paste <em> (Gochugang) </em></li>
            <li><strong> 1/2 Tbsp </strong> Sweetener (maple syrup, agave nectar, etc.) </li>
            <li><strong> 1-2 Cloves </strong> Garlic, minced </li>
            <li><strong> 1 Tbsp </strong> Lime Juice </li>
            <li><strong> 1 tsp </strong> Coconut Sugar </li>
            <li> Salt, to taste </li>
        </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>

        <ol>
            <li> Measure out the rice. 1 cup of dry rice yields about 3 cups after cooking and feeds 1-2 people. </li>
            <li> Rinse and drain the rice using a rice hat or colander. The water will start cloudy, but will drain clear when the rice is fully rinsed. </li>
            <li> Bring water and rice to a boil on high heat, uncovered. Be sure to use <strong> 1 1/4 cups </strong> of water for every <strong> 1 cup </strong> of rice. </li>
            <li> Once the rice starts foaming, reduce heat to low and cover. </li>
            <li> Let cook for 12 minutes. <strong><u> Do not lift the lid! </u></strong> Removing the lid releases the steam and will dry out the rice. </li>
            <li> Remove from heat and let the rice stand for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li> Fluff the rice with a rubber spatula. <em> Place finished rice in the fridge for 1 hour if preparing cold wraps. </em></li>
            <li> Slice the bell peppers, avocados, and cucumber into spears; julienne the carrots. You can make the lettuce slightly smaller than the rice paper wraps or shred it, to your preference. </li>
            <li> For cold wraps, skip to Step 10. For hot wraps, pan-fry them in vegetable oil with salt, pepper, garlic, and paprika. </li>
            <li> Fill a large bowl with warm water. Be careful not to make it too hot and burn yourself. </li>
            <li> One at a time, place a sheet of dry rice paper in the water and soak for 10 seconds. Place on a flat surface then add rice and fillings in a line across the center of the paper.
                 Be careful not to overfill the paper, or you risk tearing it apart as you roll it. </li>
            <li> Fold the sides of the rice paper inwards, covering the ends of the line of filling. </li>
            <li> Fold the bottom edge of the paper up and over the filling, tucking it snugly underneath the filling. </li>
            <li> Roll the wrap forward, and repeat! </li>
            <li> For the sauce, simply combine all ingredients into a small bowl and stir until combined.</li>
        </ol>
        
    <h2> Additional Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Add a meat of your choice for additional protein. These go great with anything from shrimp to shredded beef, or tofu for a fully vegan dish. </li>
            <li> These can be served as an appetizer, entree, or dessert, depending on the fillings. Try making sweet rice and adding mangos and strawberries for a refreshing treat! </li>
        </ul>
